# RDS-OpenAI-Chat

This project is an Angular application that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 to provide a chat interface. The frontend is built with Angular, and the backend uses Express and the OpenAI API.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v14 or higher
- NPM v7 or higher
- Angular CLI v15.2.4 or higher
    
## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required dependencies:

3. Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key:
